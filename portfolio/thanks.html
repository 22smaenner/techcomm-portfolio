                <h2>Thanks</h2>
                <p>I want to express my thanks to the many people who have made this possible. Truly, I would not be here without your hard work and support.</p>
                <p>First, I would like to thank Dr. Alan Houser, who was my professor for Information Architecture &amp; Content Strategy Lab. He taught me every single skill that I used in creating this portfolio site.</p>
              <p>Next, I want to shout out my advisors. To Dr. Abdesalam Soudi in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pittsburgh: He is the reason I came to Pittsburgh in the first place, and has been such a wonderful personal and professional contact both before and since graduation. To Dr. Suguru Ishizaki and Jen Loughran in the Department of English at Carnegie Mellon University: they have made my graduate studies fulfilling, and have been great sources of advice.</p>
              <p>Of course, every professor and mentor I've had also require copious thanks, but there's too many of you to list each one.</p>
              <p>A special "thank you!" to Dr. J. Patrick Mayo and his entire lab team in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. They have been gracious colleagues and were there for me when I really needed it.</p>
              <p>More recently, thank you to Bridget Decker and the Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering Marketing &amp; Communications team for introducing me to the world of professional communications.</p>
              <p>Last but certainly not least, my friends and family who have stood by me through everything. I love you all.</p>
              <p>If you're curious about the type I used in this site, the paragraph text is called 'ArnoPro' and it was made in 2007 by Robert Slimbach and can be downloaded from Adobe, while the header text is called 'Luminari'. It was made by Philip Bouwsma in 2010 and can be found at Canada Type.</p>
