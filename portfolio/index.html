                        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
                            <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio site. I am a professional and technical writer, mostly doing science writing. I love learning about the world and helping other people learn about it too. It's so fun and satisfying when a problem finally "clicks" and you understand it, and I want to help people feel that too.</p>
                            <p>I love listening to people talk about what they do and how that's meaningful to them, and I aim to create connections between them.</p>
                            <p>I have a background in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities, which has helped me be able to connect with people of numerous points of view and make connections between material that may seem less obvious.</p>
                            <p>For example, in my undergraduate studies I had an interest in perceptual neuroscience, especially when it came to categorical perception of stimuli like speech sounds. We perceive the world categorically in other ways, as well, such as in perceiving sex, gender, and gender roles in society. I hope to be able to study and write about this topic more in the future. I am also interested in communication strategies, particularly about the impacts of disease on society. I hope to pursue an independent research project in the fall about the rhetorical startegies of government agencies such as the CDC during beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the ways in which these strategies succeeded and where they could have improved where they failed.</p>
                            <p>I also like working in visual design. I particularly enjoy document design, and I designed and coded this entire site from scratch.</p>
                            <p>I hope you enjoy your look around the site!</p>
